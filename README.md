# :heart: Python-Pathfinder 
My goal for this project was to implement simple graph and tree algorithms. As you can see, this is not a big project, I would rather call **Pathfidinder** a fun example of use of those algorithms. This program is using mechanics of very popular type of games: Bomberman. You just move your square in the maze, place bombs and try not to be cought by enemy evil squere. Enemy always knows where you are **Now two players can play at once"**

## Technologies and algorithms 
I programmed it with Python 3.7 :snake:with Pygame library.

A* pathfinding algorithm allows enemy to trace player.

Prim's Minimal Spanding Tree algorithm is used to generate random maze in which you can move

## How to start playing game?
Clone the repo. Run `python pathfinder.py`.

## How to play
Player 1: use WSAD for movement and space to place bombs

Player 2: use arrows to move :arrow_up::arrow_down::arrow_left::arrow_right: and enter to place bombs

If you both die, or you destroy your enemy, you can restart game by pressing key "R"
