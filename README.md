# :heart: Python-Pathfinder ![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/mit/mit.svg?v=102) ![my badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-under_development-blue)
My goal for this project was to implement sophisticated graph's and tree's algorithms. As you can see, this is not a big project, I would rather call **Pathfidinder** a fun example of use of these algorithms. This program is using mechanics of very popular type of games: Bomberman. You just move your square in the maze, place bombs and try not to be cought by enemy evil squere, who alweays know where you are **Now two players can able at once"**

## Technologies and algorithms 
I programmed it in Python 3.7 version :snake:with Pygame library, but don't worry, if you want to play my **Pathfinder**, but you don't have python on your machine, I have prepared .exe for you :heart:
A* pathfinding algorithm allows enemy block to trace player block
Prim's Minimal Spanding Tree algorithm is used to generate random maze in which you can move

## How to start playing game?
Just download this repo into your hard drive, unpack it, run pytfinder.exe

## How to play
Player 1: use WSAD for movement and space to place bombs
Player 2: use arrows to move :arrow_up::arrow_down::arrow_left::arrow_right: and enter to place bombs
If you both die, or you destroy your enemy, you can restart game by pressing key "R"
